# Primitives
string, number and boolean

1. string - "Hello, world"
2. number - 42 (no difference in int and float etc, all nums)
3. boolean - true / false

String / Number / Boolean with capitals are legal but for certain built-in types. Use non-capitals.

## Arrays
[1,2,3]
syntax:
````
number[],
string[]

or 

Array<number>
````

## any
special type, any, can be used anywhere & whenever we don't want a particular value to cause typechecking errors.

it is very useful when I don't want to write out a long type just to convice TypeScript that a particular line of code is okay.
